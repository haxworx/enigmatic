sleep:
        what to do after we sleep to save power while the
        world mines crypto and no GPU to play ark??? :(
playback:
        when we rotate...what to do?

portability:
        Really need to avoid proc_info* function calls outside
        of the logger otherwise linking is unacceptable and
        also kvm requires setgid on OpenBSD...acceptable in
        the main program...
